Doc Stmt: I used ChatGPT to explain .then chaining and how it uses promises to sequentially run everything.
I also looked up how to generate a random number and found that Math.random() exists in javaScript. I also
used ChatGPT to explain why my program wasn't doing anythin on the web page. It told me that I needed to add
an event listener and showed me the general form of how to make one.
